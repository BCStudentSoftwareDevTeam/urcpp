         Dear {{ldap.firstname}}:
         <ol>
            <li> You are required to submit an electronic abstract of the project, which is due to the Deanâ€™s Office by August 19, {{year}}.</li>
            <li>The abstract will be shared with the Dean of Faculty, and with the Development office (for donors) and published in the annual
            Journal of Undergraduate Research Abstracts; thus, it can be discipline-specific.</li>
           <li>The abstract should be one paragraph of text only (no photos or graphics),
           and must include the title of the project and the names of all the researchers.</li>
         </ol>
      </p>
      
      <p>
         We ask this to help provide the committee with some context for this project in light of your ongoing scholarship at Berea College.
      </p>
