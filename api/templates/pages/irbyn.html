      Berea College takes its commitment to ethical considerations regarding 
      research involving human subjects very seriously. In 2015, policies were updated 
      regarding how research involving human subjects is reviewed and approved at the
      College. If your study involves human subjects in any way, it would be wise
      to <a href   = "http://catalog.berea.edu/en/Current/Student-Handbook/Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities/Research-Involving-Human-Subjects"
            target = "_blank">
      review those guidelines now.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      All URCPP proposals involving human subjects requre (at least) a draft IRB application at this time. 
      If you have any questions or uncertainty in this regard, it is highly recommended that you discuss your 
      work with <a href = 'mailto:{{cfg["contacts"]["irbChairEmail"]}}'>the current IRB chair</a>.
