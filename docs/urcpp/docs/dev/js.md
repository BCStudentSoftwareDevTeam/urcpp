# Developing in JavaScript

I know nothing about developing in JavaScript.

## The Musts

1. Spaces, not tabs.

1. 2 spaces per indent level.

1. UNIX line endings.

Those two are for sanity. They're arbitrary, and now law. If you aren't using an editor that can do this, always, then get a new editor or fix the one you've got.

## The Shoulds

* Although it's about HTML, your HTML should always be perfectly indended. Don't screw around with this... clean HTML is the rule, not spaghetti.

* Always indent neatly.

* Prefer short lines.

* Use libraries whenever sensible.

* See the Python recommendations.
